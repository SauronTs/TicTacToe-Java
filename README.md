## TicTacToe

A very simple game everyone should know. 
I wrote it to test a few things out.
A human player plays against the AI.
The AI itself is actually unbeatable, the best thing you can achieve is a draw.
But of course you can try it out. Challenge accepted ;)

#### Version

This is the Java version of the game.
You can find the twin repo written in C++ here on my github or directly https://github.com/SauronTs/TicTacToe

#### Things used
No graphics libraries. Only simple text output.
The AI decides their moves using the minimax algorithm, whereby the complete tree is computated and used.

#### Signing
Testing the commit signing for github.
