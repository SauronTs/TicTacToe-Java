## TicTacToe

A very simple game everyone should know. 
I wrote it to test a few things out.
A human player plays against the AI.
Can you beat the AI? ;)

#### Version

This is the Java version of the game.
You can find the twin repo written in C++ here on my github or directly https://github.com/SauronTs/TicTacToe

#### Things used
No graphics libraries. Only simple text output.
The AI decides their moves using the minimax algorithm, whereby the complete tree is computated and used.

#### Performance test
AI vs AI: 
You can the test the performance of this program on different systems and see the difference between C++ and Java.
This project is just for fun, so don't expect super optimizations etc...

Please keep in mind that the AI will always achieve a draw. The because both AI's are using the full minimax algorithm.

Note: Its called "Player" and "AI" because of the human playable version which is on the main branch. I didn't change it.
